### Notebooks
The Notebooks folder has two files

Demi_new_version.ipynb is the file that contains the code written in the newer version of Pytorch (This is working as of December 2020)

Demi_old_version.ipynb is the file that contains the code which was written 1 year ago so this is pretty obsolete.
